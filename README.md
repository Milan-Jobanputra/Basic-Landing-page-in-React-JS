Basic Landing page in React JS

Set up a new React application (if you haven't already). You can use Create React App or any other method you prefer.

npx create-react-app landing-page

cd landing-page

Create a new component for the landing page. You can call it LandingPage.js. This component will contain the entire landing page structure. 

Create a component for the Hero section. This section will display your hero product.

Style your components using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components. Here's a simple CSS example for the HeroSection component:

Finally, at last start your React application:

npm start

You now have a basic landing page with a hero product section in React.js. Customize the content, styles, and additional sections to fit your specific needs.
